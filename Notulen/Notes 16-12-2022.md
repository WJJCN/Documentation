Notes 16-12-2022

Overal: 
Everything looks great. Nice work with Lambda, Next, and Python 

Frontend:
Products results page: 
- Dont make it expandeble. Maybe like a table where all not found/incorrect are opened up and have a filter above where you can filter on correct/incorrect/found/not found. 
- The label incorrect should be found or like found but not correct. 
- Have per tab a % like: Title is 80% and make what is wrong red .
- If it is like soft correct like 'Energy Drink' but found is 'energy drink' make it correct but have like a warning. Or like a soft correct.
- Overal score is the combined score of every tab. Paste everystring and then check everything and make a score of this. 
- Show a label where it is found in the body or in the meta. 

Scraper: 
- Bullitpoints should be split up
- Strict check ecerything but not on uppercase/lowercase and special letters. 
- SEO tags: Include the body and the meta both. But show where you found it in the frontend. 
- Scraper serverless maken

Overal
